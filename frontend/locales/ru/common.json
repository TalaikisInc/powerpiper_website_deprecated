    "welcome": "Welcome to PowerPiper - the marketplace of super-smart and super-clean energy. Sell what you have, get what you need.",
    "intro_title": "Intro",
    "intro_1": "Blockchain technology, which is the backbone of digital currency, has the potential to disrupt financial services, by reducing the cost and complexity of financial transactions, by also increasing transparency. But digital financial transactions come with a real-world price: the tremendous growth of cryptocurrencies has created an exponential demand for computing power. As bitcoin grows, the math problems computers must solve to make more bitcoin get more and more difficult.",
    "intro_2": "Already, the aggregate computing power of the bitcoin network is nearly 100,000 times larger than the world’s 500 fastest supercomputers combined. The total energy use of this web of hardware is huge — an estimated 31 terawatt-hours per year. Did you know that more than 150 individual countries in the world consume less energy annually? And that power-hungry network is currently increasing its energy use every day by about 450 gigawatt-hours, roughly the same amount of electricity the entire country of Haiti uses in a year.",
    "about_title": "Server Co-location & Sustainable Energy for Blockchain Miners",
    "about_1": "The service we offer can be referred as “AirBnB for servers”. On our platform, we get together the blockchain mining server hosting Seekers, which are cryptocurrency miners consuming electrical power and emiting heat to Providers - businesses and private entities, who can host servers with physical space, great electricity price and reliable inernet connection.",
    "about_2": "Most of Providers are planning to use server heat, which will be rewarded with our unique “CO2 saver bonus” system, in from of our cryptocurrency called PWP. All the activity between seekers and providers will be monitored by our IoT sensors and logged to the Ethereum Blockchain to serve both sides of the contract with transparency and independant audit, also the value transfer, automated escrow and insurance services offered by us.",
    "about_3": "Savings for both sides are obvious: instead of power consumption on two sites, it’s consumed only where waste heat will be useful. Real life examples could be hotel bathrooms with towel radiators, greenhouse farms, dry cleaning businesses, mountain holiday resorts and so on.",
